The image is a grayscale scene depicting a cobblestone street at sunset or sunrise. The street is bustling with people walking in the distance, and several birds are scattered around, casting long shadows across the cobblestones. Above, birds are flying in the sky against a backdrop of scattered clouds. On either side of the street, silhouettes of buildings can be seen, including one with a tower. The lighting creates a dramatic effect with the sun at the horizon. 

On the right side of the image, there is a colorful vertical band composed of various blocks in different hues, like red, blue, yellow, and green, suggesting a digital glitch or artifact. There are no visible text or diagrams in the image.
